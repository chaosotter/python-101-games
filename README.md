# 101 Python Computer Games

## What's this all about?

If you grew up in the 8-bit microcomputer era, you may be familiar with
David Ahl's [101 BASIC Computer Games](http://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/),
which provided type-in BASIC program listings for an enormous set of games taken
from the pages of [Creative Computing](https://archive.org/details/creativecomputing).

It was true then and it's true now: one of the best ways to learn programming
is to extend and modify simple game programs!

Now, interpreted BASIC is not exactly a hot commodity these days, so this
project provides a Python version of each game that mimicks the functionality
of the original quite closely -- with the addition of color, upper/lowercase,
and some improvements to output.

What's that?  You miss the old BASIC code?  That's not included here, but I do
happen to be working on a Microsoft-compatible BASIC interpreter in pure
Python, which will be capable of running the code directly.  Please contact me
at meiss.mark `at` gmail.com to learn more about the project status.
